                                In the prefectural tournament finals with his team trailing 1-0, striker Yoichi Isagi,
                                heeding the words from his coach about soccer being a team game, opts to pass the ball
                                to his wide open teammate rather than shooting at the goal himself, and his teammate
                                misses. The opponent takes the ball the other way with their captain Ryosuke Kira
                                kicking the match-clinching goal to advance to the national tournament. Sometime later,
                                Isagi is summoned to the Japan Football Union, and he finds himself being one of 300
                                strikers confined at a remote soccer training facility called Blue Lock directed by
                                coach Jinpachi Ego, being put through a survival boot camp in order to develop the
                                ultimate striker for the Japan national football team with the winner becoming the
                                team's starting striker and the rest banned from playing for the national team. The
                                first trial is a game of tag in which the person who is struck by a kicked ball is 'it',
                                and whoever is 'it' when time expires is eliminated. The lowest-ranked striker Gurimu
                                Igarashi starts out being 'it', and Isagi ends up being tagged to become 'it'. Rather
                                than choosing to eliminate Igarashi while he is down, Isagi takes the risk to eliminate
                                a stronger player, and just before time expires he tags Kira to eliminate him.</span>

                                In a meeting at the JFU, new recruit and creator of Blue Lock Anri Teieri criticizes the
                                board for their way of thinking. Back at Blue Lock, Ego explains to Kira that his lack
                                of egoism made him unfit to be the ultimate striker as he leaves Blue Lock. Ego then
                                explains that the 11 players remaining will form Team Z and live together with the
                                message that at times the players will work together and at other times betray each
                                other. Afterwards, the players train and eat together. At night, Isagi practices with
                                teammate Meguru Bachira, and Bachira explains that he has some monster inside of him
                                that tells him the best course of action. Afterwards, Ego explains that as teams are
                                assigned based on player rank and Team Z has all the lowest-rated players. He then
                                explains the next trial that will be a group play tournament against the other four
                                teams in their building, one of five in the facility, with the top two teams advancing.
                                With all players being forwards that Ego has tasked the players to play soccer from
                                zero. Team Z prepares to play their first match against Team X.</span>

                                With Isagi struggling mentally, he asks Kumigami why he plays soccer, responding that he
                                idolizes strikers as real-life superheroes and wants to become on. Kumigami also
                                explains that goal scorers get bonus points to spend for stuff to improve quality of
                                life at Blue Lock, and Kumigami uses his for a steak he shares with Isagi as gratitude
                                for the assist. Kumigami also tells Isagi that he has a special talent for sensing where
                                to go with the ball to score goals. The next day, Team Z and Team Y play a match that
                                amounts to an elimination game with both teams losing badly in their first match. Team Z
                                puts their position rotation strategy into motion with Bachira starting out as the
                                striker, but Bachira struggles as his shots get blocked. Team Y then puts their plan
                                into motion to focus on defense, then steal the ball and following a long pass to the
                                team's best player Hibiki Ohkawa, he scores on a breakaway to give Team Y a 1-0 lead.
                                Having taken the lead, Team Y deploys stall tactics by passing the ball around to run
                                out the clock, but Team Z steals possession and ties the match with a goal from Gin
                                Gagamaru, all while Isagi notices that Ohkawa's teammate Ikki Niko is the team's true
                                leader who is calling the shots.</span>
