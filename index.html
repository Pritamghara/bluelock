                                The story begins with Japan's elimination from the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which prompts
                                the
                                Japanese Football Union to start a programme scouting high school players who will begin
                                training in preparation for the 2022 Cup. Isagi Youichi, a forward, receives an
                                invitation to
                                this programme soon after his team loses the chance to go to Nationals because he passed
                                to his
                                less-skilled teammate —who missed— without trying to make the game-changing goal by
                                himself.

                                Their coach will be Ego Jinpachi, who intends to “destroy Japanese loser football” by
                                introducing a radical new training regimen: isolate 300 young strikers in a prison-like
                                institution called “Blue Lock” and put them through rigorous training aimed at creating
                                “the
                                world's greatest egotist striker.”</span></div>
