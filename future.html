            <img src="images/19.jpg" alt="">
            <span>Following the premiere of season 1 episode 24, 8bit released a new promo video announcing their
                decision to greenlit the production of Blue Lock season 2 and a movie based on the spinoff series,
                Episode Nagi.

                After seeing the popularity of the series, fans were certain that the anime would receive a second
                season. However, the franchise getting a movie so early in its run was definitely a surprise. This is
                due to the fact that both the original manga and the Episode Nagi spinoff series have a high manga sales
                circulation.
                As per Oricon Weekly Manga Sales chart, Blue Lock volume 23 has the highest number of sales with nearly
                200,000 copies sold worldwide. And, with nearly 85,000 copies sold globally, Blue Lock: Episode Nagi
                volume 2 has the fifth-highest number of sales.
                Upon hearing the news about the second season, fans were left ecstatic as they could not wait for the
                upcoming arc, featuring the match against Japan's u-20 team. The upcoming arc will feature one of the
                best matches to be brought into existence in the manga, as the two teams are set to go toe-to-toe in a
                stadium filled with audiences rather than an empty facility.
